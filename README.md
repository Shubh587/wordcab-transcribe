# Wordcab Transcribe üí¨

FastAPI based API for transcribing audio files using [`faster-whisper`](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper) and [`pyannote-audio`](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio)

More details on this project on this [blog post](https://wordcab.github.io/wordcab-posts/blog/2023/03/31/wordcab-transcribe/).

## Key features

- ü§ó Open-source: Our project is open-source and based on open-source libraries, allowing you to customize and extend it as needed.
- ‚ö° Fast: The faster-whisper library and CTranslate2 make audio processing incredibly fast compared to other implementations.
- üê≥ Easy to deploy: You can deploy the project on your workstation or in the cloud using Docker.
- üî• Batch requests: You can transcribe multiple audio files at once because batch requests are implemented in the API.
- üí∏ Cost-effective: As an open-source solution, you won't have to pay for costly ASR platforms.
- ü´∂ Easy-to-use API: With just a few lines of code, you can use the API to transcribe audio files or even YouTube videos.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Docker
- NVIDIA GPU + NVIDIA Container Toolkit

## Docker commands

Build the image.

```bash
docker build -t wordcab-transcribe:latest .
```

Run the container.

```bash
docker run -d --name wordcab-transcribe \
    --gpus all \
    --shm-size 1g \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    -p 5001:5001 \
    wordcab-transcribe:latest
```

## Test the API

Once the container is running, you can test the API.

The API documentation is available at [http://localhost:5001/docs](http://localhost:5001/docs).

### Using CURL

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:5001/api/v1/youtube' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'file=@/path/to/audio/file.wav'
```

### Using Python

```python
import requests

filepath = "/path/to/audio/file.wav"  # or mp3
files = {"file": open(filepath, "rb")}
response = requests.post("http://localhost:5001/api/v1/audio", files=files)
print(response.json())
```

## Local testing

Before launching the API, be sure to install torch and torchaudio on your machine.

```bash
pip install --upgrade torch==1.13.1+cu117 torchaudio==0.13.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```

Then, you can launch the API using the following command.

```bash
poetry run uvicorn wordcab_transcribe.main:app --reload
```
